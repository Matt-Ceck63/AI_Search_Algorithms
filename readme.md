There is a file for each question:

UCS: contains the uniform cost search algorithm implementation with answers for b,c,d, each with its 
own specific fitness function. The nodes are defined using the networkx library.

Uncomment print statements in ucs() and reduce the numer of iterations to get the answer to b

Genetic_algorithm: contains the genetic search algorithm implementation:
	- SECTION 1: algorithm adapted from search.py in AI: a modern approach github
	- SECTION 2: algorithm implemented from pseudocode in AI: a modern approach book
